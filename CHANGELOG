slcview 2.0, 2003-09-15
  Code reorganization.  Now has Slcview.pm module which allows all the main
  working procedures to be used by others more easily.
  New features:
    Allows specification of default options in system slcview.conf and user
    .slcviewrc files
    Does a basic autoscaling of gtrresolution, atrresolution, genelabels, and
    arraylabels.
  Other minor algorithm and organization changes.

slcview 1.1.2, 2003-03-16
  Fixes inconsistencies in color specification parameters.  Tweaked legend
  file output to no longer cut off labels.

slcview 1.1.1, 2002-03-26
  Oops.  Was a little premature with releasing the code to draw labels.
  That created some bugs with not having .atr or .gtr files around.
  Those should be fixed now, so you can have any combination of +/-
  gene tree, gene labels, array tree, or array labels.

slcview 1.1, 2002-03-24
  Now will draw gene labels and array labels.
  Legend image has been changed from horizontal to vertical, this makes
  it a little easier to draw labels for all the color shades.

slcview 1.0, 2002-03-21
  initial version of slcview.pl (v1.0)
  All options work pretty well.
  Output is very good, user control over appearance is also pretty good.
  Left to do:
    better scale diagram labelling, perhaps more options
    draw gene and array names on the picture
